###### Version 1.1.0

<br />

## Usage

- Install [EmoTracker](https://emotracker.net/download/).
- Download the current tracker pack from EmoTracker's package manager (cloud symbol) in the "Others" section at the bottom.
- Open EmoTracker and select "OoTMM Randomizer Item Tracker" under `"Installed Packages" -> "Other"` in the settings menu.

This setting is purely cosmetic. Since there are many items that can be shared between games that have different appearances between games (i.e. Mirror Shield, Hero's Bow, Longshot, etc.), this setting allows you to toggle between which the tracker should use.

This setting configures what the max wallet size in your seed is. All this does is sets what the max wallet you can track is.

![Progressive Knife + Biggoron](https://github.com/ariahks/ootmmrando_ariahks/blob/main/images/options/progressive_knife_and_biggoron.png?raw=true)

This setting determines whether any skulltula tokens should be trackable. If it's set to "Gold", then only Ocarina of Time's Gold Skulltula Tokens will be trackable.

## To-Do List

There are a number of ways that I would like to improve this tracker over time, but I can't promise any kind of consistency in updates. That said, here are some of the things I'd theoretically like to add given infinite time.

- The ability to configure silver rupee pouches for individual sets, rather than only as a group by dungeon.
- Both an "Unshared Items" variant and an "Unshared Items w/ Souls" variant.
- Map Tracker??? (long shot)

I may add or remove stuff from this list at any time.
